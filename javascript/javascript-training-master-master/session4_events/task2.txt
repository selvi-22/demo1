Debouncing
Some types of events have the potential to fire rapidly, many times in a row (the
"mousemove" and "scroll" events, for example). When handling such events,
you must be careful not to do anything too time-consuming or your handler
will take up so much time that interaction with the document starts to feel
slow.
If you do need to do something nontrivial in such a handler, you can use
setTimeout to make sure you are not doing it too often. This is usually called
257
debouncing the event. 

<textarea>Type something here...</textarea>
<script>
let textarea = document.querySelector("textarea");
let timeout;
textarea.addEventListener("input", () => {
clearTimeout(timeout);
timeout = setTimeout(() => console.log("Typed!"), 500);
});
</script>
