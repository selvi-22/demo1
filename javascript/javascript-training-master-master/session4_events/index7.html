        /*
        For most event types, handlers registered on nodes with children will also receive events that happen in the children. If a button inside a paragraph is
clicked, event handlers on the paragraph will also see the click event.
But if both the paragraph and the button have a handler, the more specific
handler—the one on the button—gets to go first. The event is said to propagate
outward, from the node where it happened to that node’s parent node and on to the root of the document. Finally, after all handlers registered on a specific
node have had their turn, handlers registered on the whole window get a chance
to respond to the event.
At any point, an event handler can call the stopPropagation method on the
event object to prevent handlers further up from receiving the event.
