    <h1>What Does “Full-Stack Developer” Mean?
    </h1>
    <!--Clas Selectors is overrided by ID Selector-->
    <h2 class="classOne" id="idOne"> Before becoming a full-stack developer, you need to understand the term “full-stack.”
        Developers working in a “full-stack” capacity work on both frontend and backend development projects.

    </h2>

    <h2 id="idOne">Frontend development (or client-side development) projects include anything that users see. It
        includes websites and web applications that customers interact with (like the interface of an ecommerce web
        application).

    </h2>
    <h2 class="classOne">Backend development (or server-side development) projects include any behind-the-scenes part of
        a website or web app. Specifically, backend development focuses on three things:

        <dl>
            <dt>The server:</dt>
            <dd>The computer that runs the backend of the website</dd>
            <dt>The database:</dt>
            <dd>The space where the website stores its data</dd>
            <dt>Application</dt>
            <dd>The tool that communicates with the server and database</dd>
        </dl>
