Primitives - Default values, range

When representing a float data type in Java, 
we should append the letter f to the end of the data type; 
otherwise it will save as double. 
The default value of a float in Java is 0.0f. 
Float data type is used when you want to save memory 
and when calculations don't require more than 6 or 7 digits of precision.
